# MEditor
Every self-respecting c++ graphics programmer has renderer application using OpenGL and ImGui, so I decided to catch up

Project goals
1. Loading/Saving scenes and models (scene graph)
2. Editing object properties in toolbar (UI) and in editor (Triad, Mouse Picking)
3. Orbit camera and panning
4. Materials and lights
   
# Day 1

What's done
1. Mesh (transform, name, color)
2. Camera (position, front/up/right, fov)
3. ImGui toolbar for renaming Mesh and editing it's transform
